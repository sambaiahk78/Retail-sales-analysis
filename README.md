# Retail-sales-analysis
A retail sales analysis project using python ,pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Objective
Analyzed retail sales data to identify trends and insights using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Key Findings
- *Category-wise Sales*: [Insert which category had the highest sales, e.g., "Clothing had the highest sales at 67,890, indicating strong demand."] *(Check the output of print(category_sales) in Colab to fill this.)*
- *Gender-wise Sales*: [Insert whether Male or Female spent more, e.g., "Female customers spent more (45,000) compared to Male customers (35,000)."] *(Check the output of print(gender_sales).)*
- *Age-wise Sales*: [Insert which age group spent the most, e.g., "The 26-35 age group spent the most, contributing 45,000 to total sales."] *(Check print(age_group_sales) if you did binning, or mention ages 30 and 50 spent the most.)*
- *Monthly Trends*: Sales peaked in May 2023 at around 50,000, likely due to seasonal promotions, while September 2023 saw the lowest sales at around 20,000.
